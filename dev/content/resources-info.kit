                <p>He says, <span>“People are born so that they can learn how to live a good life, like loving everybody
                        all
                        the time and being nice… Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don’t have to stay as
                        long.”</span></p>

                <h1>What is Cancer?</h1>
                <p>Dog cancer, like human cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells on or within the body. Although
                    there
                    are many types of cancer, they still start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells.
                    Normal
                    body cells grow, divide and die in an orderly fashion. During the early years of a dogs life, normal
                    cells divide rapidly until the dog becomes and adult. After that, cells in most parts of the body
                    divide
                    only to replace worn out or dying cells and to repair injuries. Because cancer cells continue to
                    grow
                    and divide, they are different from normal cells. Instead of dying, they outlive normal cells and
                    continue to form new abnormal cells.</p>

                <p>Cancer cells develop because of damaged DNA. This substance is in every cell and directs all
                    activities.
                    Most of the time when DNA becomes damaged the body is able to repair it. In cancer cells, the
                    damaged
                    DNA is not repaired. Dogs can inherit damaged DNA, which accounts for inherited cancers. More often,
                    though, a dog’s DNA becomes damaged by exposure to something in the environment, like smoke,
                    pesticides,
                    or other carcinogens.</p>

                <p>Cancerous tumors can spread to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal
                    tissue. This process is called metastasis. For example, breast cancer that spreads to the liver is
                    still
                    called breast cancer, not liver cancer. Regardless of where a cancer may spread, however, it is
                    always
                    named for the place it began.</p>

                <p>Not all tumors are cancerous. Benign (non cancerous) tumors do not spread (metastasize) to other
                    parts of
                    the body and, with very rare exceptions, are not life threatening.</p>

                <p>Different types of cancer and behave very differently. For example, bone cancer and breast cancer are
                    very different diseases. They grow at different rates and respond to different treatments. That is
                    why
                    dogs with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer.</p>

                <p>Cancer rates increase in dogs with age. It is the leading cause of death in dogs over 10 years.</p>
